Feature: Series Solver

Scenario Outline: Solving series
    Given I have a series <First> <Operator> <Second> <Operator> <Third> <Operator> ...
    When I solve the series
    Then I should get <Solution> as the answer

    Examples:

      | First | Second | Third | Operator | Solution |
      | 1     | 2      | 3     | +        | -1/12    |
      | 1     | 1/2    | 1/4   | +        | 2        |
      | 1/0!  | 1/1!   | 1/2!  | +        | e        |

# Scenario Outline: Adding series
#     Given I add the following series:
#       | Series                                                        | Operator   | Solution   |
#       | <First> <Operator> <Second> <Operator> <Third> <Operator> ... | <Operator> | <Solution> |
#     When I solve the series
#     Then I should get <Solution> as the answer

#     Examples:
#       | First     | Second    | Third     | Operator | Solution |
#       | 3/10      | 3/100     | 3/1000    | +        | 1/3      |
#       | 1+3^(2*0) | 1+3^(2*1) | 1+3^(2*2) | *        | -1/2     |
#       | 1/2       | 1/4       | 1/8       | +        | 1        |
